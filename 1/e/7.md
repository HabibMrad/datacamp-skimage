## Trying other methods

As we saw in the video, not being sure about what thresholding method to use isn't a problem. In fact, scikit-image provides us with a function to check multiple methods and see for ourselves what the best option is. It returns a figure comparing the outputs of different **global** thresholding methods.

Image loaded as `fruits_image`.

You will apply this function to this image, `matplotlib.pyplot` has been loaded as `plt`. Remember that you can use `try_all_threshold()` to try multiple global algorithms.

### Instructions

- Import the try all function.

- Import the rgb to gray convertor function.

- Turn the fruits image to grayscale.

- Use the try all method on the grayscale image.
