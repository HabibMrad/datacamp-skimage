## Histograms

In this exercise, you will analyze the amount of red in the image. To do this, the histogram of the red channel will be computed for the image shown below:

Image loaded as `image`.

Extracting information from images is a fundamental part of image enhancement. This way you can balance the red and blue to make the image look colder or warmer.

You will use `hist()` to display the 256 different intensities of the red color. And `ravel()` to make these color values an array of one flat dimension.

Matplotlib is preloaded as `plt` and Numpy as `np`.

Remember that if we want to obtain the green color of an image we would do the following:

```python
green = image[:, :, 1]
```

### Instructions

- Obtain the red channel using slicing.

- Plot the histogram and bins in a range of 256.
