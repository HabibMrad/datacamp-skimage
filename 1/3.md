## Flipping out

As a prank, someone has turned an image from a photo album of a trip to Seville upside-down and back-to-front! Now, we need to straighten the image, by flipping it.

Image loaded as `flipped_seville`.

Using the NumPy methods learned in the course, flip the image horizontally and vertically. Then display the corrected image using the `show_image()` function.

NumPy is already imported as `np`.

### Instructions

- Flip the image vertically.

- Now, flip the vertically-flipped image horizontally.

- Show the, now fixed, image.
