## Apply global thresholding

In this exercise, you'll transform a photograph to binary so you can separate the foreground from the background.

To do so, you need to import the required modules, load the image, obtain the optimal thresh value using `threshold_otsu()` and apply it to the image.

You'll see the resulting binarized image when using the `show_image()` function, previously explained.

Image loaded as `chess_pieces_image`.

Remember we have to turn colored images to grayscale. For that we will use the `rgb2gray()` function learned in previous video. Which has already been imported for you.

### Instructions

- Import the otsu threshold function.

- Turn the image to grayscale.

- Obtain the optimal threshold value of the image.

- Apply thresholding to the image.
