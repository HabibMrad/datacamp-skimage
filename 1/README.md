# Introducing Image Processing and scikit-image

## About this chapter

Jump into digital image structures and learn to process them! Extract data, transform and analyze images using NumPy and Scikit-image. With just a few lines of code, you will convert RGB images to grayscale, get data from them, obtain histograms containing very useful information, and separate objects from the background!
