## Find contours of an image that is not binary

Let's work a bit more on how to prepare an image to be able to find its contours and extract information from it.

We'll process an image of two purple dices loaded as `image_dices` and determine what number was rolled for each dice.

In this case, the image is not grayscale or binary yet. This means we need to perform some image pre-processing steps before looking for the contours. First, we'll transform the image to a 2D array grayscale image and next apply thresholding. Finally, the contours are displayed together with the original image.

<!-- `color`, `measure` and `filters` modules are already imported so you can use the functions to find contours and apply thresholding. -->

We also import `io` module to load the `image_dices` from local memory, using `imread`. [Read more here](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.io.html).

### Instructions

- Transform the image to grayscale using `rgb2gray()`.
