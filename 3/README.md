# Image restoration, Noise, Segmentation and Contours

So far, you have done some very cool things with your image processing skills! In this chapter, you will apply **image restoration to remove objects, logos, text, or damaged areas** in pictures! You will also learn how to apply noise, use segmentation to speed up processing, and find elements in images by their contours.
