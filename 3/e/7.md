## Superpixel segmentation

In this exercise, you will apply unsupervised segmentation to the same image, before it's passed to a face detection machine learning model.

So you will reduce this image from 265 Ã— 191 = 50,615 pixels down to 400 regions.

Already preloaded as `face_image`.

The `show_image()` function has been preloaded for you as well.

### Instructions

- Import the `slic()` function from the `segmentation` module.

- Import the `label2rgb()` function from the `color` module.

- Obtain the segmentation with 400 regions using `slic()`.

- Put segments on top of original image to compare with `label2rgb()`.
