## Number of pixels

Let's calculate the total number of pixels in this image.

![Young woman](../i/6.jpg)

<!-- Image preloaded as `face_image` -->

The total amount of pixel is its resolution. Given by HeightÃ—Width.

Use `.shape` from NumPy <!-- which is preloaded as `np`, --> in the console to check the width and height of the image.

### Possible Answers

- `face_image` is 191 * 191 = 36,481 pixels

- `face_image` is 265 * 191 = 50,615 pixels

- `face_image` is 1265 * 1191 = 1,506,615 pixels

- `face_image` is 2265 * 2191 = 4,962,615 pixels
