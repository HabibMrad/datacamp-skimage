## Less corners

In this exercise, you will test what happens when you set the minimum distance between corner peaks to be a higher number. Remember you do this with the `min_distance` attribute parameter of the `corner_peaks()` function.

<!-- The functions `show_image()`, `show_image_with_corners() `and required packages have already been preloaded for you. As well as all the previous code for finding the corners. The Harris measure response image obtained with `corner_harris()` is preloaded as `measure_image`. -->
 
### Instructions

- Find the peaks of the corners with a minimum distance of 2 pixels.

- Find the peaks of the corners with a minimum distance of 40 pixels.

- Show original and resulting image with corners detected.
