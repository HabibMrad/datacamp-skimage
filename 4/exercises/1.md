In this exercise you will identify the shapes in a grapefruit image by detecting the edges, using the Canny algorithm.

![Grapefruits](../i/1.jpg)

<!-- Image preloaded as `grapefruit`. -->

<!-- The `color` module has already been preloaded for you. -->
<!-- 
### Instructions

- Import the canny edge detector from the feature module.

- Convert the image to grayscale, using the method from the color module used in previous chapters.

- Apply the canny edge detector to the `grapefruit` image.
