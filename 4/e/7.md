## Segmentation and face detection

Previously, you learned how to make processes more computationally efficient with unsupervised superpixel segmentation. In this exercise, you'll do just that!

Using the `slic()` function for segmentation, pre-process the image before passing it to the face detector.

Image located at `i/7.jpg`.

<!-- Image preloaded as `profile_image`. -->

<!-- The `Cascade` class, the `slic()` function from segmentation module, and the `show_detected_face()` function for visualization have already been imported. The detector is already initialized and ready to use as `detector`. -->
<!-- 
### Instructions

- Apply superpixel segmentation and obtain the segments a.k.a. labels using slic().

- Obtain the segmented image using label2rgb()

- Detect the faces, using the detector with multi scale method.
