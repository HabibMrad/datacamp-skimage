## Less edgy

Let's now try to spot just the outer shape of the grapefruits, the circles. You can do this by applying a more intense Gaussian filter to first make the image smoother. This can be achieved by specifying a bigger sigma in the canny function.

In this exercise, you'll experiment with sigma values of the `canny()` function.

Image located at `i/2.jpg`.

<!-- Image preloaded as `grapefruit`. -->

<!-- The `show_image` has already been preloaded. -->

### Instructions

- Apply the canny edge detector to the grapefruit image with a sigma of `1.8`.

- Apply the canny edge detector to the grapefruit image with a sigma of `2.2`.

- Show the resulting images.
