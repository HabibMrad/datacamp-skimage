# Filters, Contrast, Transformation and Morphology

You will learn to **detect object shapes** using edge detection filters, improve medical images with contrast enhancement **and even enlarge pictures to five times its original size**! You will also apply morphology to make thresholding more accurate when segmenting images and go to the next level of processing images with Python.
