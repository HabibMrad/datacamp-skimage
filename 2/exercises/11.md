## Improving thresholded image

In this exercise, we'll try to reduce the noise of a thresholded image using the dilation morphological operation.

![World map](../images/11.jpg)

<!-- Image already loaded as `world_image`. -->

This operation, in a way, expands the objects in the image.
<!-- 
## Instructions

- Import the module.

- Obtain the binarized and dilated image, from the original image `world_image`.
