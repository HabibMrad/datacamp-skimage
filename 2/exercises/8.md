## Enlarging images

Have you ever tried resizing an image to make it larger? This usually results in loss of quality, with the enlarged image looking blurry.

The good news is that the algorithm used by scikit-image works very well for enlarging images up to a certain point.

In this exercise you'll enlarge an image **three times**!!

You'll do this by rescaling the image of a rocket, that will be loaded from the `data` module.

### Instructions

- Import the module and function needed to enlarge images, you'll do this by rescaling.

- Import the `data` module.

- Load the `rocket()` image from data.

- Enlarge the `rocket_image` so it is 3 times bigger, with the anti aliasing filter applied. _Make sure to set `multichannel` to `True` or you risk your session timing out!_
