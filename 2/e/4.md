## Medical images

You are trying to improve the tools of a hospital by pre-processing the X-ray images so that doctors have a higher chance of spotting relevant details. You'll test our code on a chest X-ray image from the National Institutes of Health Chest X-Ray Dataset

![X-ray chest image](../i/4.png)

<!-- Image loaded as `chest_xray_image`. -->

First, you'll check the histogram of the image and then apply standard histogram equalization to improve the contrast. Remember we obtain the histogram by using the `hist()` function from Matplotlib.
<!-- , which has been already imported as `plt`. -->
<!-- 
### Instructions

- Import the required Scikit-image module for contrast.
